# Create a function that solves a Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.
# Provide a 9x9 grid representing the puzzle with some numbers filled in and others left blank.
# Implement a backtracking algorithm to check for valid placements in empty cells, ensuring no row, column, or 3x3 subgrid contains duplicates.
# Solve the puzzle by filling in the remaining empty cells with valid numbers.
